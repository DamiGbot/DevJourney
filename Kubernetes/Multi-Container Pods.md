# Multi-Container Pods

## Design Patterns

### Sidecar Pattern

The Sidecar pattern involves adding a helper container to a Pod to support the main application container. This is often used for logging, monitoring, or configuration purposes.

### Adapter Pattern

The Adapter pattern allows legacy applications to interface with new environments by adding a container that adapts output to the required format or protocol.

### Ambassador Pattern

The Ambassador pattern involves adding a helper container that acts as a proxy, managing communication between the main application container and the outside world or other services.

## Concept of Init Containers

Init containers are special containers that run before the main application container in a Pod. Each init container must complete successfully before the next one starts. Once all init containers are finished, the main application containers are started. This is useful for setup tasks like initializing data or ensuring dependencies are met.

### Example YAML for Init Containers

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: my-pod
spec:
  initContainers:
    - name: init-myservice
      image: busybox
      command: ["sh", "-c", "echo Initializing...; sleep 10"]
  containers:
    - name: my-app
      image: nginx
```

### Benefits of Multi-Container Pods

- Separation of Concerns: Each container can handle a specific responsibility, making the application more modular.
- Resource Sharing: Containers within the same Pod share the same network namespace and can communicate easily.
- Improved Manageability: Supporting tasks like logging, monitoring, and configuration can be managed separately from the main application logic.
