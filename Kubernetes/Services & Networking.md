# Services & Networking

## Services

Services in Kubernetes are used to enable communication between different objects (such as Pods) within the cluster, or between the cluster and the outside world. They abstract away the underlying Pods, providing a stable endpoint for communication even if the underlying Pods change.

### Types of Services

- **NodePort**: Exposes the service on a static port on each node in the cluster. This allows external access to the service using `<NodeIP>:<NodePort>`.
- **ClusterIP**: The default type, which exposes the service on a cluster-internal IP. This type of service is only accessible from within the cluster.
- **LoadBalancer**: Exposes the service externally using a cloud provider’s load balancer. This type is common in cloud environments where you want to expose services to the internet.

## Ingress

### Problem Statement

As applications grow in complexity, managing multiple services and exposing them to external users becomes challenging. Traditional service types like NodePort and LoadBalancer work well for simple use cases but are less efficient when dealing with many services or when needing more sophisticated routing capabilities.

### What is Ingress?

Ingress is a Kubernetes resource that provides external access to services within a cluster, typically via HTTP or HTTPS. It acts as an entry point to your cluster, routing incoming traffic to the appropriate services based on defined rules. Ingress can also provide load balancing, SSL termination, and name-based virtual hosting.

### Services vs. Ingress

- **Services**: Directly expose Pods to external traffic (e.g., NodePort or LoadBalancer). Suitable for simple use cases but can become inefficient with many services.
- **Ingress**: Centralizes and manages access to multiple services. It provides more advanced routing, load balancing, and SSL termination features.

### When to Use Ingress?

Use Ingress when you need:

- Advanced routing (e.g., path-based or host-based routing).
- SSL/TLS termination.
- A single external IP to expose multiple services.
- More granular control over traffic routing to your services.

### Ingress Controller

An Ingress resource requires an Ingress Controller to function. The Ingress Controller is responsible for fulfilling the Ingress rules. Some popular Ingress Controllers include:

- **GCE (Google Cloud Load Balancer)**
- **NGINX**
- **HAProxy**
- **Traefik**

### Ingress Resources

When defining Ingress resources, it’s important to specify the `host` field in your rules to control which hosts can access which services. If the `host` field is not specified, the Ingress will accept traffic from any host. You can define a default backend to handle requests that don’t match any rules, often returning a 404 error page.

### Ingress Types

1. **Single Backend**: Routes all traffic to a single service.

```yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: single-backend-ingress
spec:
  rules:
    - http:
        paths:
          - path: /
            pathType: Prefix
            backend:
              service:
                name: my-service
                port:
                  number: 80
```

2. **Simple Fanout (Rules Using Single Host)**: Routes traffic based on different paths under the same host.

```yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: simple-fanout-ingress
spec:
  rules:
    - host: example.com
      http:
        paths:
          - path: /foo
            pathType: Prefix
            backend:
              service:
                name: foo-service
                port:
                  number: 80
          - path: /bar
            pathType: Prefix
            backend:
              service:
                name: bar-service
                port:
                  number: 80
```

2. **Name-Based Virtual Hosting**: Routes traffic to different services based on the host.

```yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: name-based-virtual-hosting-ingress
spec:
  rules:
    - host: foo.example.com
      http:
        paths:
          - path: /
            pathType: Prefix
            backend:
              service:
                name: foo-service
                port:
                  number: 80
    - host: bar.example.com
      http:
        paths:
          - path: /
            pathType: Prefix
            backend:
              service:
                name: bar-service
                port:
                  number: 80
```

2. **TLS**: Adds SSL/TLS termination to your Ingress, ensuring secure connections.

```yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: tls-ingress
spec:
  tls:
    - hosts:
        - example.com
      secretName: tls-secret
  rules:
    - host: example.com
      http:
        paths:
          - path: /
            pathType: Prefix
            backend:
              service:
                name: my-service
                port:
                  number: 80
```

## Network Policies

In Kubernetes, all Pods and Nodes can communicate with each other by default without any additional network configuration. This open communication can sometimes be undesirable, especially in scenarios where you need to enforce security boundaries or limit access between different parts of your application. This is where **Network Policies** come into play.

### What are Network Policies?

A **Network Policy** is a Kubernetes object that allows you to specify a set of rules to control the traffic flow to and from Pods. These policies define what traffic is allowed to ingress (enter) or egress (exit) from selected Pods. By default, if no Network Policy is applied, all traffic is allowed.

### Key Points:

- **Selectors**: Network Policies use label selectors to determine which Pods the policy applies to. The `podSelector` is used to select the Pods that the policy will apply to.
- **Ingress and Egress**: You can define rules for both incoming (ingress) and outgoing (egress) traffic. These rules specify the allowed sources and destinations for the traffic.

### Sample YAML for Network Policies

#### Example 1: Ingress Policy with Multiple Sources

This Network Policy allows incoming traffic only from Pods with the label `app=frontend` and from a specific IP block.

```yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: NetworkPolicy
metadata:
  name: allow-ingress-from-frontend
spec:
  podSelector:
    matchLabels:
      app: myapp
  policyTypes:
    - Ingress
  ingress:
    - from:
        - podSelector:
            matchLabels:
              app: frontend
        - ipBlock:
            cidr: 192.168.1.0/24
      ports:
        - protocol: TCP
          port: 80
```

- **Explanation**:
  - The policy applies to Pods with the label `app=myapp`.
  - It allows ingress traffic on port 80 from:
    - Pods with the label `app=frontend`.
    - Any IP address in the `192.168.1.0/24` subnet.

#### Example 2: Egress Policy with Multiple Destinations

This Network Policy allows Pods to send traffic only to a specific DNS service and to Pods with a specific label.

```yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: NetworkPolicy
metadata:
  name: allow-egress-to-dns-and-db
spec:
  podSelector:
    matchLabels:
      app: myapp
  policyTypes:
    - Egress
  egress:
    - to:
        - podSelector:
            matchLabels:
              app: database
        - namespaceSelector:
            matchLabels:
              name: kube-system
      ports:
        - protocol: TCP
          port: 53
```

- **Explanation**:
  - The policy applies to Pods with the label `app=myapp`.
  - It allows egress traffic on port 53 (typically DNS) to:
    - Pods with the label `app=database`.
    - Any Pods in the `kube-system` namespace.

#### Example 3: Egress Policy with Both `podSelector` and `namespaceSelector`

```yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: NetworkPolicy
metadata:
  name: allow-egress-to-backend-in-prod
spec:
  podSelector:
    matchLabels:
      app: myapp
  policyTypes:
    - Egress
  egress:
    - to:
        - podSelector:
            matchLabels:
              app: backend
          namespaceSelector:
            matchLabels:
              env: prod
      ports:
        - protocol: TCP
          port: 8080
```

### Explanation:

- **podSelector**: The policy applies to Pods with the label `app=myapp`.
- **egress**: This section defines the allowed egress traffic.
  - **to**:
    - **podSelector**: Specifies that traffic is allowed only to Pods with the label `app=backend`.
    - **namespaceSelector**: Specifies that traffic is allowed only to Pods in the namespace with the label `env=prod`.
  - **ports**: Traffic is allowed only on TCP port 8080.

### Use Case:

- This Network Policy allows Pods with the label `app=myapp` to send egress traffic only to Pods that have the label `app=backend` and are in the namespace labeled `env=prod`.
- For instance, this could be used in a scenario where you want to restrict egress traffic from a front-end application to only the backend services that are running in a production environment.
